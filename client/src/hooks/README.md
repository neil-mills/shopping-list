This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Shopping List

Personal React project to track the price of weekly shopping. I have used a stack of Graph QL, Apollo Server and Mongo DB on the backend and Apollo Client on the front end.

## Running the app

Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` from the project root directory to launch the frontend at `http://localhost:8080` and the backend at `http://localhost:3000`
The Graph QL API url is at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

## Running tests

Run `npm run test` or `yarn test` from the project root directory
